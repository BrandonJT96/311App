    <h3>First Phone Call - Jan 27, 2019 [1:15pm]</h3>
    <h4>Pre-planned questions with answers:</h4>
    <p><i>Note that we didn't get all of our questions answered in this phone call.</i></p>
    <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: serif; font-size: 12;">What source control did you want to use? GitHub?
A: 

Did you want two separate native apps or a web app that will work universally across all platforms? Tell them the reason we think a web app would be the best is because with a web app we can cover all bases at once, Android, iOS, Windows, mac, everything. If someone reports it on their phone than the clerk can log in and see what the report says and issue what’s necessary.
A: 

Do you have a graphical designer for how it should look or did you have a color palette in mind? Mention that they threw out a bunch technology stacks but we really wanted to narrow down exactly what we are doing.
A: 

Really figure out what their expectations are, that’s something we need to figure out. Because we don’t want them thinking they will have a 100% full functioning, beautifully designed, infinitely scaleable application.
A: 

Ask them how they are wanting to monetize exactly? I.e. could it be charging the cities a relatively small amount and not showing advertisements to users?
A: He doesn’t expect it to be a final product. We won’t necessarily have to figure out this part yet. They expect this to be a first draft to be scrapped and redone later if it presents well to a hedge fund.

Do you have any general idea of what milestones to aim for?
A: It’s up to us. Milestones aren’t really set up. Basically, meet the milestones and time frames presented in class. 

Does Brain have a time that we could contact him?
A: He can jump in the calls if he’s needed. He said he’d rather not get him involved if possible.

<b>One caveat:</b> Brain is the one to ask technical questions. It is up to us to decide how to implement it. As long as it matches the general idea, we can do it our way. Also, another team in Washington state already tried to do this same project and failed. They didn’t take it seriously or something so Brain isn’t going to try to help this time. So it is up to us.

<b>Notes/what he(Morgan) said:</b> The main gist behind is that most municipalities out here don’t have apps that focus on non-emergency situations. They want to come up with a generalized app that any city and municipality can use at a reasonable price. NY had to pay 250k for theirs. This app will cut out redundancy and generalize the process. There could be scope creep. We need it to be geared towards the citizen, nothing more, nothing less. Most people won’t use all of the features. Main idea is to create a working product for them to show off so they can get funding.
