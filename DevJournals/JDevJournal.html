		<h2>Week of Jan 7 to Feb 2</h2>
		<h3>Week Summary</h3>
		<p>This week we established a meeting scheduled to meet on a weekly basis via a conference call. I was unfortunately 
    unable to be on the first conference call because I had prior responsibilities on this day. I did, however, get notes 
    and brought up to speed by my teammates.</p>
		<p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The application does not have to be complex.</li>
      <li>We are not the only university working on this product</li>
      <li>We are developing a MVP for the customer to show to investors to help the real product
      gain traction.</li>
      <li>Making decisions are mostly left to us, however any technical questions we can ask via a task software
      called Asana.</li>
      <li>The requirements that we have been given, allow for free reign. I believe that it is preferred to 
      deliver a more simplistic application rather than a complicated application.</li>     
		</ul>
