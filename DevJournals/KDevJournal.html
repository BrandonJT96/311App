		<h2>Week of Jan 7 to Feb 2</h2>
		<h3>Week Summary</h3>
		<p>This week we spoke with the customer to determine their baseline requirements for the application.
		As stated in the original project description, the customer wishes to create a web application which
		will provide citizens of a municipality to report non-emergency issues, much like how a 311 line operates
		in cities across the country. We also established a weekly meeting schedule with the customer to ensure
		that they are kept in communication with us throughout the process.</p>
		<p>Notes for this week's meeting are below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The application we are building does not need to have complex features integrated, but needs
				to have basic functionality that works well. The product we create will ultimately be used
				as a proof of concept or working demo so that the customer may pursue funding to continue
				building their idea into an more detailed and profitable product.</li>
			<li>We are not the only university working on this product for the customer; they have a group of
				students at a university in Washington working on their own version of the product as well.
				Of course, we are to work completely individually, but there may be a time in which the customer
				would like our team to consult with this team during a meeting.</li>
			<li>Making decisions about the direction of the project should be made mostly by our team, but if
				a technical question must be answered, we may send the customer a message. Details about the
				program are up to the team to determine, as long as it fits the requirements previously
				given by the customer.</li>
